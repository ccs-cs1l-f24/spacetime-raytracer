THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

To run the program, use `cargo run`.

Requires Vulkan, Rust, Cargo, and a sane windower (preferably also shaderc + Vulkan validation layers).

Uses custom vulkano and egui/egui_winit_vulkano forks (TODO add additional remote for them in ccs-cs1l-f24 so yall can also build)
