Spacetime Softbody Raytracer

[THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS]

This repository contains the code for my spacetime raytracer. However, it depends on custom forks of a few Rust libraries to build.

If you wish to build this project, or view it in fuller context, refer to [the monorepo](https://github.com/ccs-cs1l-f24/spacetime-raytracer-monorepo).
